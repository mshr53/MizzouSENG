# Social Data Visualizer

The code utilizes a Huffington Post API that can grab various polling
information from primaries to elections and various other topics. This
specific implementation displays data for the Republican (GOP) candidates
for the 2016 Presidential Election. The project uses the Huffington Post
API to recieve data, then uses D3.js to display the data in the form of
a horizontal bar graph.
